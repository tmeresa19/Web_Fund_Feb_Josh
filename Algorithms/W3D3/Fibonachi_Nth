//How to write an if/else statement in a new way:




// let stopLight = "green"

// stopLight === "red"? stop : go;



// The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0, 
// the second number is 1, and the nth numer is the sum of the (n -1)th and (n -2)th numbers.
// Write a function that tkaes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

// Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.
//  For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonnacci number is F0; 
//  therefore, getNthFib(1) is equal to F0, getNthFib(2) is equal to F1, etc..


// [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]



// Because: 0 + 1 = 1, and 1 + 1 = 2, and 1 + 2 = 3, and 2 + 3 = 5 and so on.....



function getNthFib(n) {
  const lastTwo = [0,1];
  let counter = 3;
  //then do something here


  return n > 1 ? lastTwo[1] : lastTwo[0];
}
